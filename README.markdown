# What is this thing?

This is an attempt at creating a blockchain in Java from scratch.

### Why?

Just for the fun of it really. I'm fascinated with blockchain technology and 
what better way to learn about it than to create my own?

### Implemented (at least partially)

* Merkle Tree creation/manipulation.
* Fractions instead of decimals for the token value (cleaner divisibility, 
	novel, less chance of floating-point rounding errors)
* Block structure
* Proof of Work (Scrypt)

### TODO
* Wire protocol (Protobuf?, JSON?, ???)
* Transaction language
* User Interface for transferring tokens
* Economic decisions (inflation rate, pre-allocation, mining rewards, etc...)

### License

Released in the public domain. I would appreciate credit where possible. :)
